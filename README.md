This is where I started to learn about C++. 
I have currently made it through my variables and expressions. 
I still have some learning to do.

# Development Environment

I have been writing this program entirely in C++. 

I did have to use the iostream library. It runs the complier for C++. 

# Useful Websites

These are the websites that I referenced while learning C++ itself. 

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_variables.asp)
- [Java Point](hhttps://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-expression)

# Future Work

- Learn and write about conditionals. 
- Learn and write about loops.
- Learn and write about functions.
- Learn and write about classes.
- Learn and write about data structures.
