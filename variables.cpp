/* Create a variable using the following syntax*/
/* type variableName = value; */

/* Types of variables */

int favNumber = 6;

/* Double */
/* Floating numbers (can be negative) */
double favDecimal = 0.24;

/* Char */

char firstInitial = 'S';

/* String */

string basicPhrase = "Hello World!";

/* Booleans */
/* True or False */
bool myBoolean = true;

/* Learned how to display these variables */
cout << basicPhrase <<
    "I am Samantha." <<
    "My favorite number is " << favNumber << 
    "and my favorite decimal is " << favDecimal <<
    ". " << "That will always be " << myBoolean <<
